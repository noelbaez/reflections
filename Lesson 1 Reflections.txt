Reflections - Git & GitHub
==========================

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

* Because using an automatic tool it helped me to see the latest changes in the file 
  in a quick way.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

* For instance, you can have different versions of an app and in case you lost the most 
  recent one you just take the latest version available instead of create the app from scratch.
* You can create new versions and make experimental changes without the fear of break the app.
   
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    PROS
    + I actually decide when to do a commit and create a version rather than 
      wait the system to do automatically.
    + The criteria of when to do a commit is up to you.

    CONS
    - I can forget to create a commit 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   * I think it's because Git is oriented for developers, where normally are various 
   files related to each other.
 
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    * Using command: git log --stat 
      I can see the history of modifications with detail. Number of lines modified,
      number of lines inserted, delete, ...

    * Using command: git log
      i can see the history of files without detail

    * Using command: git diff commitA commitB
    I can see the detail of modificaciones between these two versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

   * I can make changes to an app without fear to brake the code, because
     I can recover it easily

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    * Want to know how to create commits, how to define wich files are related in the commit.
    * Want to know how to create a repository
