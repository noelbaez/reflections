When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    * To be able to work remotely
    * To do team work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    * Because if you pull changes manually you avoid Git accidentally update 
      the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    * Fork:   is when you clone a repository from GitHub into your GitHub account.
    * Clone:  is when you clone a repostitory from GitHub to your local computer
    * Branch: is when you create a branch, a label for a commit

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    * You can work/see that version locally (offline) 
    * You can see the latest changes other people have made on the master branch
